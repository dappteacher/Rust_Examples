# ðŸ“¦ Understanding `Box` in Rust

In Rust, `Box<T>` is a smart pointer used for heap allocation. It allows you to store data on the heap instead of the stack, which is useful for large data, recursive types, or trait objects.

---

## ðŸš€ Why Use `Box`?

- **Heap Allocation**: Useful for large data that may not fit on the stack.
- **Recursive Types**: Necessary for types like linked lists or trees that reference themselves.
- **Trait Objects**: Required when you want to store a trait or use polymorphism.

---

## ðŸ”§ Syntax

```rust
let b = Box::new(5);
println!("b = {}", b);
````

* `Box::new(value)` places the value on the heap and returns a `Box<T>` that points to it.

---

## ðŸ§  Behind the Scenes

```text
Stack:
| pointer to heap |

Heap:
| actual value (e.g., 5) |
```

Box allocates on the **heap**, but the pointer (Box) itself lives on the **stack**.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Example: Storing Large Data on Heap

```rust
fn main() {
    let large_array = Box::new([0; 1000]);
    println!("First item: {}", large_array[0]);
}
```

---

## ðŸª¢ Recursive Types Example

```rust
enum List {
    Cons(i32, Box<List>),
    Nil,
}

use List::{Cons, Nil};

fn main() {
    let list = Cons(1, Box::new(Cons(2, Box::new(Nil))));
}
```

* Recursive types require `Box` to prevent infinite size at compile time.

---

## ðŸ§° Trait Object with Box

```rust
trait Animal {
    fn speak(&self);
}

struct Dog;

impl Animal for Dog {
    fn speak(&self) {
        println!("Woof!");
    }
}

fn main() {
    let my_pet: Box<dyn Animal> = Box::new(Dog);
    my_pet.speak();
}
```

* `Box<dyn Trait>` enables dynamic dispatch and polymorphism.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Dereferencing a Box

Box implements the `Deref` trait, so you can use `*box` to access the inner value:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 10;
    let y = Box::new(x);

    assert_eq!(x, *y); // Deref coercion
}
```

---

## ðŸ§¹ Box is Automatically Dropped

When a Box goes out of scope, both the heap and stack data are cleaned up automatically.

```rust
struct Droppable;

impl Drop for Droppable {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        println!("Droppable has been dropped");
    }
}

fn main() {
    let _boxed = Box::new(Droppable);
}
```

## âœ… Summary

| Feature         | Description                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `Box<T>`        | Heap-allocated smart pointer          |
| Syntax          | `Box::new(value)`                     |
| Recursive Types | Enables self-referential structures   |
| Trait Objects   | Enables dynamic dispatch (`Box<dyn>`) |
| Auto Cleanup    | Dropped when it goes out of scope     |
