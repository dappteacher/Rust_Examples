# ‚öôÔ∏è Borsh Serialization in Rust

**Borsh** stands for **Binary Object Representation Serializer for Hashing**. It's a binary serialization format designed to be:

- **Deterministic**
- **Efficient**
- **Simple**
- **Cross-platform**

It is widely used in blockchain ecosystems, especially in the [NEAR Protocol](https://near.org/).

---

## üì¶ Why Use Borsh?

- Faster than JSON or other text-based formats.
- Fixed output for the same input (great for hashing and Merkle trees).
- Suitable for smart contracts or systems where binary compactness and determinism matter.

---

## üîß Add Dependencies

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
borsh = "1.4"
borsh-derive = "1.4"
````

---

## üß± Define Your Struct

Use the `#[derive(BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize)]` macros to enable serialization:

```rust
use borsh::{BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize};

#[derive(BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize, Debug)]
struct User {
    username: String,
    age: u8,
    active: bool,
}
```

---

## üíæ Serialization

Convert a struct into bytes:

```rust
fn main() {
    let user = User {
        username: "Jacob".to_string(),
        age: 32,
        active: true,
    };

    let serialized_data = user.try_to_vec().expect("Serialization failed");
    println!("Serialized bytes: {:?}", serialized_data);
}
```

---

## üìÇ Deserialization

Convert binary data back into a struct:

```rust
fn main() {
    let user = User {
        username: "Alice".to_string(),
        age: 28,
        active: false,
    };

    let bytes = user.try_to_vec().unwrap();

    let deserialized_user = User::try_from_slice(&bytes).expect("Deserialization failed");

    println!("Deserialized struct: {:?}", deserialized_user);
}
```

---

## üìÅ File I/O Example

Writing and reading a serialized struct from a file:

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{Write, Read};
use borsh::{BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize};

#[derive(BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize, Debug)]
struct Book {
    title: String,
    pages: u32,
}

fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    let book = Book {
        title: "Rust By Example".to_string(),
        pages: 350,
    };

    // Serialize and write to file
    let mut file = File::create("book.borsh")?;
    let encoded = book.try_to_vec().unwrap();
    file.write_all(&encoded)?;

    // Read and deserialize from file
    let mut file = File::open("book.borsh")?;
    let mut buffer = Vec::new();
    file.read_to_end(&mut buffer)?;

    let loaded_book = Book::try_from_slice(&buffer).unwrap();
    println!("Loaded from file: {:?}", loaded_book);

    Ok(())
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes and Tips

* Always handle errors using `.unwrap()` or better: `?` operator or `match`.
* Structs must have a stable and deterministic order of fields for Borsh to work properly.
* Borsh does **not** support maps (`HashMap`, `BTreeMap`) by default ‚Äî you must implement custom serialization if needed.
