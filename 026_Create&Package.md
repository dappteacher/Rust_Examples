# 📦 Crates and Packages in Rust

In Rust, the terms **crate** and **package** are fundamental concepts in project organization and dependency management. Understanding them is key to structuring and scaling your Rust applications.

## 🧱 What Is a Crate?

A **crate** is the smallest compilation unit in Rust. Every crate is compiled independently by the Rust compiler.

There are two main types of crates:

- **Binary Crate**: Produces an executable (has a `main` function).
- **Library Crate**: Produces a reusable library (does not have a `main` function).

> 📝 A single Rust project can contain multiple crates, but each compiled file is considered its own crate.

---

## 📦 What Is a Package?

A **package** is a bundle of one or more crates that provides a set of functionality. A package:

- Contains a `Cargo.toml` file.
- Can contain **zero or one library crate**.
- Can contain **any number of binary crates**.

> ✅ A package is what you publish to [crates.io](https://crates.io), the Rust package registry.

## 🗂️ Example Structure

```text
my_project/
│
├── Cargo.toml        ← Defines the package
├── src/
│   ├── main.rs       ← Binary crate
│   └── lib.rs        ← (Optional) Library crate
````

## 🧪 Creating a Package

To create a new binary package:

```bash
cargo new my_project
```

To create a library package:

```bash
cargo new my_library --lib
```

---

## 🔧 Cargo.toml File

This file contains metadata and dependencies for the package.

```toml
[package]
name = "my_project"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
serde = "1.0"
```

---

## 📁 Multiple Binaries

You can add multiple binaries in a single package by creating a `src/bin` directory:

```text
src/
├── main.rs
├── bin/
│   ├── tool1.rs
│   └── tool2.rs
```

Then run them using:

```bash
cargo run --bin tool1
```

---

## 🔗 External Crates

To use an external crate (e.g., `serde`), add it to `Cargo.toml` and then in your code:

```rust
use serde::Serialize;

#[derive(Serialize)]
struct MyStruct {
    name: String,
    age: u32,
}
```

## 📚 Summary Table

| Concept      | Description                                   |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Crate        | A single compilation unit (binary or library) |
| Package      | One or more crates managed via Cargo          |
| `Cargo.toml` | Package manifest file                         |
| `main.rs`    | Entry point for a binary crate                |
| `lib.rs`     | Entry point for a library crate               |
